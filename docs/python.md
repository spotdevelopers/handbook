## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
